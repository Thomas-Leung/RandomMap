# random_map
Random Map is an application designed to assist in restaurant selection based on your nearby location. 

I developed this app because my friends and I often struggle to choose what to eat when we hang out.

## Features
- Select a restaurant based of types and distance.
- Show direction.
- User has the option to reselect another restaurant.
